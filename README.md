# Utilities for deep learning algorithms

Ill be posting a lot of different nets implemented in tensorflow. They are divided into two sets, one for text applications and the other for vision applications. 

## Folder info.

1. vision_apps : Code for image datasets (MNIST, etc)
2. text_apps : Code for lang. corpuses 
3. basic_tutes : Tensoflow basics 
4. re_inforce : Code for reinforcement learning. (It includes OpenGym)

## Important info 

1. Pre-trained word2vecs : https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/ : Google word-to-vecs on Google news , billions of words
